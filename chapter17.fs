//First case: Functors F, G, Ga = Gb
//The naturality condition: alpha b o Ff = Gf o alpha a
// but Gf = id, so: alpha a = alpha b o Ff. On point Fa.:
// Ga = alpha b Fb = Ga
//So the natural transformation can be defined only in terms of a single
//component.
//Second case:
//Fa = Ga => alpha a = id => alpha b o Ff = Gf
//he natural transformation can be defined only in terms of a single component.
//Also the natural transformation can be seen as an application of the reader
//functor on morphism Ff.
//Third case: f : a->a
//We have then:
// Fb = Fa, Ga = Gb =>
// alpha a = alpha b => the natural transformation acts like a morphism
//between single objects F and G: alpha: F->G
